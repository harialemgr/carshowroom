      Crafting unique experiences by enhancing usability, accessibility and pleasure of the user interaction with the website. UX design is a broad term that incorporates lots of aspects. Generally speaking, this is the way the layout of your web resource is organized from both inside and out. If one digs deeper, he/she will find out that there are two big types of the web designs. The first one is dynamic and the second – static. The latter is built on the basic HTML code. The former is powered by the latest, superior technologies. They allow the static website to increase its upload and download time, while also reducing the CPU and network load of your computer</p>
